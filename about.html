            Hello, <br> <br>
            I recently otained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from San Diego State University.I had my first PC when I was nine years old, 
            and since then, have always been intrigued on how they operate. This sparked a passion in me and made me go into the Computer Science field because I knew I always wanted to be working with
            technology and computers. My goal in life is to continue working with computers as a software developer or web developer with a company
            that solves complex modern-day problems.
